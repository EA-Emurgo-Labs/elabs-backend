# Setup
Before running Changeblock Server we need to setup few Environment variables and load funds.

## 1. Load Collateral UTXO & Fund to Root address
To view collateral address we can simply run following command and send exactly 5 ADA  to that address.

  ```shell
    make show-internal-collateral-address
  ```

To view normal interal address we can run following command and send Some ADA to that address.
  ```shell
    make show-internal-address
  ``` 

## 2. Create Oracle
To create oracle we need to run   
```
  cabal run elabs-backend:app -- createOracle --rate <some_rate_in_lovelace>
```

We need to export variable displayed in output of terminal once createOracle script is completed.

## 3. Deploy Marketplace Script
we can simply run following command to deploy Marketplace script.
```
  cabal run elabs-backend:app -- deployScript
```
Like Oracle we need to export variable displayed in output of terminal after script is completed.
